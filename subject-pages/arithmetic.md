### Place Value
A **digit** refers to the numbers 0 through 9 and stems from the fact that we typically have 10 fingers we can utilize to represent those numbers. **Place value** defines the value of the digits included within a number, which is determined based on the digit's position. Each time the position of the digit's place value moves toward the left it increses by 10. 
* The smallest place value are the **ones** which corresponds to the 0 - 9 digits
* The place value to the left of the ones are the **tens**. 
* The place value to the left of the tens are the **hundreds**. 
* The place value to the left of the hundreds are the **thousands**. 
* The place value to the left of the thousands are the **ten thousands**. 
* The place value to the left of the ten thousands are the **hundred thousands**. 
* The place value to the left of the hundred thousands are the **millions**. 

Then the pattern continues with the next relevant place value being a **billion**, then after that is a **trillion**, and so on.

When we **round** we're moving the number to the nearest place by evaluating the value to the left of that place. When the value is greater than or equal to 5 we round up and when the value is 4 or less we round down. 
* To round to the nearest 10 of 154, it would be 150.
* To round to the nearest 100 of 154 it would be 200.
